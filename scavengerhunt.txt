1. 9096 files (entered ls -al /bin into the command bar)
2. Process called "whoopsie" (installed htop "apt-get install htop") and used the program to see what processes were using the most memory
3. Central Time Zone (rackspace says it's located in Dallas)

I installed a php5 terminal interpreter for the server. But I couldn't figure out how to upload the php file onto my server... I ended up executing the file on my local machine using (php 362.php) after extracting the php file from the .tar file.
